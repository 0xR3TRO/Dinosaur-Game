## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Dinosaur Game" project aims to create an accurate replica of the popular offline game available in Google Chrome. The game will function as a standalone application, offering the same gameplay experience with additional features such as character customization and score tracking.

### Features:

- **Core Gameplay:** The player controls a dinosaur that avoids obstacles like cacti and birds by jumping or ducking.
- **Customization:** Options to change the appearance of the dinosaur and the game's background.
- **Scoreboard:** Save and view high scores achieved by the player.
- **Night Mode:** Automatic background changes depending on the time of day.
- **Offline Accessibility:** The game works without an internet connection.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements:

- **Gameplay:** The player controls the dinosaur using keyboard keys (arrows, space) or touchscreen gestures.
- **Score Tracking:** The application saves the best scores and displays them on a leaderboard.
- **Customization:** Users can modify the dinosaur’s appearance, such as its color or accessories (e.g., hats).
- **Night Mode:** The game’s background changes automatically or based on user preferences.
- **Pause and Reset:** Options to pause the game or start a new session.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Smooth Gameplay:** The game must run smoothly without lags.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** The game should work on both computers and mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for users of all ages.
- **Optimization:** Low system requirements to ensure compatibility with older devices.

## Interface Design

### Sketches/Interface Visuals:

- _Home Screen:_ Menu with options for "Start," "Leaderboard," and "Settings."
- _Game Screen:_ View of the dinosaur running across a desert landscape with obstacles and a score counter at the top.
- _Leaderboard Screen:_ List of top scores with player names and scores.

## System Architecture

### Data Structure Description:

The application will store data related to gameplay, including:

- **Scores:** A leaderboard of player scores with rankings.
- **Customization Settings:** Selected colors and accessories for the dinosaur.
- **Game Progress:** Current gameplay statistics, such as the score.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The system will use the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

- **Model:** Manages game logic, including obstacle generation and score calculation.
- **View:** Handles graphical representation of the game.
- **Controller:** Manages user input and communicates with the model and view.

## Implementation

### Technology Stack:

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Canvas API for 2D graphics).
- **Backend:** Node.js (optional, for online features like global leaderboards).
- **Database:** SQLite (to store local scores and settings).

### Code Structure:

- **Files and Folders:**
  - `game.js` (game logic)
  - `style.css` (styles)
  - `index.html` (main page)
  - `settings.js` (customization management)
- **Code Style:** Modular code with clear comments for readability and maintainability.

## Testing

### Testing Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the functionality of dinosaur movement, obstacle generation, and score calculations.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure smooth interaction between modules, such as game logic and visual representation.
- **UI Testing:** Test user interactions with the menu and gameplay on various devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Measure game performance under different speeds and obstacle densities.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop test cases for each function.
- Document and report bugs with suggestions for fixes.

## Deployment and Maintenance

### Deployment Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:**
  - Develop core gameplay mechanics.
  - Add customization and leaderboard features.
  - Perform testing and optimization.
  - Publish the application on desktop and mobile platforms.
- **Timelines:** Divide work into short sprints for efficient progress tracking.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Provide a channel for players to report issues.
- **Updates:** Regular bug fixes and new features, such as additional visual themes.
